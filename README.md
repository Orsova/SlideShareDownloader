# Slideshare-Downloader
A Python program to download a file from Slideshare as images and reassemble it as a PDF. WIP.

Given a URL, this program will extract the first jpg image, iterate across the page numbers until a 404 is returned, combine the files into a PDF and then delete the JPG files.

To Do:
Deliver a list of URLs as a txt file and have the program iterate over them.
Incorporate OCR to deliver searchable PDFs.
